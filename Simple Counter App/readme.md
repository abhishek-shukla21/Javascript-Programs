# Simple Counter App

This is a simple counter app that allows you to increase, decrease, and reset a counter value displayed on the screen. It's a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project for tracking numeric values.

## Features

- **Increase**: Click the "Increase" button to increment the counter by 1.
- **Decrease**: Click the "Decrease" button to decrement the counter by 1.
- **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to reset the counter value to 0.

The counter value is displayed in the center of the page, and its color changes depending on whether it's positive (green), negative (red), or zero (black).
